                <h2>How I work with Others</h2>
                <p>I am a <strong>collaborative</strong> worker. Throughout my time as a developer, one of my favorite things has been to get together with like-minded people and design great products. </p>
                <br>
                <h2>My personality</h2>
                <p>I have a <strong>driven</strong> personality. Whenever I set my mind to accomplish a certain goal, I make it my mission to gather the necessary resources and learn the skills necessary to accomplish that goal. Before becoming a developer at Meta+lab, I had little to no web development experience, but I spent the better part of the summer learning the needed concepts to become a part of their work force.</p> 
                <br>
                <h2>My Work Style</h2>
                <p>As a <strong>diligent</strong> worker, I make sure that the work I do is carefully made and covers all the bases needed for it to be as best as it can. While doing front-end tasks, I make sure that the content functions and looks properly while checking different view points. The same diligence is applied when checking for my teammates work so the group-work is as best as it can be.</p>
